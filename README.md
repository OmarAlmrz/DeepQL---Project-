# Deep Q-Learning Project 
The project use the gym "DeadlyGrid-v0" environment and the DQN algorithm to train an agent to navigate in a grid world and avoid obstacles. The agent is rewarded when it reaches the goal and penalized when it hits an obstacle. The agent is trained using a neural network to approximate the Q-function. 

The project was developed as an experiment to evaluate the performance of the DQN algortihm by using different optimization techniques and hyperparameters.
